Cloudflare's new analytics offering 'Cloudflare Web Analytics' promises a solution to the dichotomy of information vs privacy. Their free tier operates using a traditional `JS` beacon script loaded from Cloudflare's own domain `static.cloudflareinsights.com`, that reports back to `cloudflareinsights.com`. Cloudflare promises their solution to be 'privacy-first', and while I have very little doubt about it being the case, it won't be long before ad-blockers and other privacy-conscious tools block it - as a 3^rd^ party resource.

## Reverse Engineering the Beacon
The script Cloudflare loads is heavily minified, and while not intentionally obfuscated, is almost impossible to read. I tried looking for stray source maps and the like, but didn't find any. Instead I used [`de4js`](https://lelinhtinh.github.io/de4js/) with the [`unreadable`](https://github.com/lelinhtinh/de4js/blob/master/userscript/de4js_helper.user.js) add-on, and then ran it through [Prettier](https://prettier.io/). The `unreadable` extension uses data from [JSNice](http://jsnice.org/), and tries to rename variables back to their likely name using a statistical model[^n2p]. This works pretty well, but isn't infallible, so you have to have your whits about you and not blindly trust that a variable named `url`, is even a `URL`, for example.

Once inside, the code showed a number of options that are documented (or that I could find).

There's the option to include custom tags in the beacon requests
```js JS
...

if (window.__cfBeaconCustomTag) {
    if ("object" != typeof window.__cfBeaconCustomTag || Array.isArray(window.__cfBeaconCustomTag)) console.warn('Invalid custom tag format. Please use the following format: { "first_key": "first_value", "second_key": "second_value" }');
    state.ct = applyChange(window.__cfBeaconCustomTag)
}

...
```

This is cool but let's keep digging.

Here we find what we've been looking for, an option to configure the `URL` the beacon will pass the **R**eal **U**ser **M**etrics to.
```js JS
...

var initial = params.token
	? params.send && params.send.to
			? params.send.to
			: "https://cloudflareinsights.com/cdn-cgi/rum"
	: null;

...
```

Looking further up in the script, we can see that the `params` can be taken from the `script` tag or, interestingly for us, from `window.__cfBeacon`.

```js JS

...
var t = document.currentScript || ("function" == typeof document.querySelector ? document.querySelector("script[data-cf-beacon]") : void 0);

...

var params = window.__cfBeacon;

...

var paramJson = t.getAttribute("data-cf-beacon");
	if (paramJson) try {
	    params = JSON.parse(paramJson)
	}
...

```

So, we can pick our own `URL` using `{:js} window.__cfBeacon = {token: ANALYTICS_TOKEN, send: {to: ENDPOINT_URL}}`

## cdn-cgi

My first thought was to change this to a Cloudflare Worker proxy, sitting on the same origin. However, this isn't even necessary...

Cloudflare's `CDN` network includes a 'secret' `/cdn-cgi` directory on sites it proxies. The best-known use of this is the `/cdn-cgi/trace` document, that details information about the user's interaction with the Cloudflare network.

```ini /cdn-cgi/trace
fl=21f439
h=cloudflare.com
ip=2b00:24e3:6444:5301:fcf9:4321:29f7:abcd
ts=1609427929.302
visit_scheme=https
uag=Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 11_1_0) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/89.0.4356.6 Safari/537.36
colo=LHR
http=http/2
loc=GB
tls=TLSv1.3
sni=plaintext
warp=off
gateway=off
gateway_account_id=nil
```

It turns out that a lot of Cloudflare's services make use of this path, including their email protection, and their `rocket loader` scripts, as well as many other things[^ggl].

More pertinent to our needs, as seen in the default `URL`, `/cdn-cgi/rum` exists, and it's live on all Cloudflare-proxied sites - same origin 👌.

To solve the initial request being 3^rd^ Party, I suggest just serving the `beacon.min.js`, file yourself, as I haven't found it exposed in the same way.

## Worth it?

I'm in two minds about solving this. On one hand its somewhat futile as it only defeats `DNS` based blocking, `uBlock` or other `HTTP`-level blockers could quite easily write a rule to block this, on the other hand, Cloudflare Web Analytics is the only free limitless offering I've found that doesn't track users (not even using their IP address)[^cfp], and doesn't require cookies - so maybe it is worth trying.

There are many ways to solve the issues of simple pattern blocking, using 'Cloudflare Workers', or literally any other proxy service - but I want a simple stack and don't want to be bounded by usage limits more than necessary - optimistic, I know!

Cloudflare Web Analytics is still in beta, so it's quite possible these features will be documented or removed 😢 in the future.
